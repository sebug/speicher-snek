# Snek
The goal is to make a two-player snake game for the Tetris table.

You can test the implementation using

	python -m unittest test_snek

Or directly on the Tetris table.

	ampy --port /dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART put snek.py

Then have one of the buttons instantiate snek.Snek and play.

Here's how it looks on the simulator:
